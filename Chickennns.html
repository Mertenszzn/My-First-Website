    Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and
    the
    wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allo

    <h3>Reproduction and life-cycle</h3>
    To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the
    wing
    which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she responds to his call, the
    rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male
    approaches
    the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and
    the
    male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.[33]

    <h4>Phylogeny</h4>

    Red junglefowl, the wild ancestor of the chicken
    Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens
    belong
    to, survived the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur
    relatives.[43] Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically
    classified as the same species.[44] Domesticated chickens freely

    <h5>Domestication</h5>

    Chicken domestication and dispersal;[45] possibility of early arrival in Americas[47][48]
    According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise
    to
    the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[49] The red junglefowl is well adapted to
    take
    advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle,

    <h6>Austronesia</h6>

    Prehistoric introduction of domesticated chickens into Oceania from the Philippines via Neolithic Austronesian
    expansion
    (starting at c. 4000 BP), inferred from genetic markers on ancient and modern chicken DNA (Thomson et al., 2014)[57]
    A word for the domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language, indicating they
    were
    domesticated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times. Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were carried
    throughout the entire range of the prehistoric Austronesian maritime migrations to Island Southeast Asia,
    Micronesia,
    Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, starting from at least 3000 BC from Taiwan.[57][58][59][60] The

    <h7>Americas</h7>
    The possibility that domestic chickens were in the Americas before Western contact is debated by researchers, but
    blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens. A
    lack of
    data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay
    out
    a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds
    threatened
    by extinction may also help with research into this area.[62] Chicken bones from the Arauco Peninsula in
    south-central
    Chile were radiocarbon dated as pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis suggested they were related to prehistoric
    populations
    in Po

    <h8>Eurasia</h8>
    Chicken remains have been difficult to date, given the small and fragile bird bones; this may account for
    discrepancies
    in dates given by different sources. Archaeological evidence is supplemented by mentions in historical texts from
    the
    last few centuries BC, and by depictions in prehistoric artworks, such as across Central Asia.[65] Chickens were
    widespread throughout southern Central Asia by the 4th century BC.[65]
