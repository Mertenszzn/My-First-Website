    The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of
    Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept
    as pets or for cockfighting.

    <p> Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are
        numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>
